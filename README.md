This project is a GORP for the Auburn University Industrial Engineering department.

# What is a GORP?

GORP stands for Generalized Observation and Reflection Protocol. GORPs are a standard tool used in gathering and analyzing data collected through COPUS, or Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM.

# How is it used?

COPUS is a means of recording and judging learning activities in a classroom for the purposes of determining accreditation. There are three categories: teaching activities, student actions, and student engagement. This GORP helps to track if the appropriate quantity of actions in each of these categories occurs in classrooms (for example, if the teacher is answering enough student questions, or if the students are actively engaging with the material).
